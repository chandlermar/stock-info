Stock Deliverable

This project was completed in one day as I was on vacation from the 3/24-3/28 without access to a computer!

That being said, the core components of the project are there, and I sacrificed some functionality for a clean UX/UI.

To run the project, navigate to stock-info and type 'npm start'.

NOTE** you will need to put your AlphaVantage API key in on line 31 and 54 of CardDetails.js in place of the text "ENTERKEYHERE".
